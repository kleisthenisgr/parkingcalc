# parkingcalc
Calculates and displays parking cost with user set charge per week

After the Wordpress plugin is activated, user may set desired prices for 1st, 2nd and 3rd week or leave the default ones.
It takes into account the number of days plus the extra washing option to display the final price.
This is mostly Javascript and does not manipulate actual cart price (not for Woocommerce application).
